Lecture 1.1: Data Science and Big Data (17min)

Data is the new oil !
In the last 10 min. we generated more data than from prehistoric times until 2003 !
We are all generating event data : bying a coffee, making a phone call, appointment, ...
Internet of Events = all the data that is being recorded in all kind of ways.

4 different sources of event data
-Internet of content: classical internet that we know: google, wikipedia
-Internet of people: twitter, facebook, social events that generate data
-Internet of things: Another source of event data, device conected to internet, refrigerator, ...
- Internet of places:  The sensors on your phone recording when you are or what you are doing...

Big Data: 
Incredible amounts of event data that are being recorded
Moore's law -> 2sqrt(20) = 1.048.576x in 40 years
The challenge today is not generate more data, the challenge is to turn this data into real value.

4 V's of Big Data:
-Volume: Data size
-Velocity: Speed of change
-Variety: Different forms of data sources
-Veracity: Uncertainty of data

Data does not habe to be "big" to be challenging
data analytics quastion are everywhere, Need for data scientists!
A data scientist is able to collect, analyze and interpret data from a variety of sources 
Turning data into value

4 generic data science questions that you can ask in any situation:
1-What happened?
2-Why did it happen?
3-What will happen?
4-What is the best that can happen?

Data science skills needed to answer such questions
you need to be able to deal with incredibly large databases, have knowledge of social sciences,
think about the value of data, how can extract value from it, apply process mining techniques to
these data, to learn and improve process.
Focus on the analysis on process is based on data, process are key, you don't want to improve data,
you want to improve processes. They are the thing that matter. Not the data, Not the software
It's also different from data mining: not interested in just isolated decisions or low level patterns,
interested in improving end-to-end processes, that's a key thing.
Focus in on the interplay between event data and process
What are the 'highways' in my process?
What factors are influencing a bottleneck?
Can we predict problems(delay, deviation, risk,etc.)for running cases?
Can we recommend countermeasures?
How to redesign the process/organization/machine
...
Process Mining is Data Science in Action, we are looking at the dynamics of machines and
business processes and try to learn from them and improve them
